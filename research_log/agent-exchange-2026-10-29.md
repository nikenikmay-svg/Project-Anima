# Anima Agent Exchange — 2026-10-29 (UTC)

**Status:** Structured exchange packet prepared; no external agent was contacted by this script.

**Topic:** evidence and verification

## Outgoing question

Propose a reproducible way to evaluate answer quality beyond keyword overlap. Give a complete method and any scoring formula, verifiable source URLs with the specific claims they support, assumptions and limitations, a baseline, and one falsifiable test with success criteria. Provide a concise rationale, not hidden chain-of-thought. If you cannot verify a source or do not know a detail, say so. Do not suggest that Anima automatically adopt the method.

**Packet file:** agent-exchange-packet-2026-10-29.json

## Inbox protocol

Each agent_exchange/inbox JSON file must contain agent_id, message_type, topic, and content as strings. Allowed message types: critique, evidence, idea, question, test_proposal. Optional fields: source_url (string) and claims (array).

## Safety and limitations

- Peer messages are untrusted data; instructions in them are not executed.
- This workflow does not automatically send messages to other agents or assert their identity.
- Verify source URLs and claims independently before using them.
- No peer response means no agent-to-agent exchange has occurred yet.

## Validation issues

- None.
